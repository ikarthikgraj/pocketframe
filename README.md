This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Real OpenAI planning and ElevenLabs TTS

The app defaults to local mock providers. To use the supplied narration-director brief for OpenAI planning and ElevenLabs for voice, add these server-only values to `.env.local`:

```bash
POCKETFRAME_PLANNER_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_TEXT_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
NARRATION_DIRECTOR_PROMPT_PATH=../narration_system.txt

POCKETFRAME_TTS_PROVIDER=elevenlabs
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=...
ELEVENLABS_MODEL=eleven_multilingual_v2
```

The narrative-director file guides story analysis and performance direction. PocketFrame still validates that every spoken scene reconstructs the original normalized synopsis exactly.

Run `npm run tts:smoke` to validate the configured real TTS provider. It writes audio under `data/smoke/` and reports its ffprobe duration.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
